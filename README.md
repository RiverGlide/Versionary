# Welcome to the RiverGlide website

## But first...
It's recommended that you use [rvm](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) with a clean [gemset](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/gemsets/basics/)

    rvm use 1.9.2@riverglide.com --create

That will ensure you're using rvm ruby 1.9.2 with a clean gemset called riverglide.
